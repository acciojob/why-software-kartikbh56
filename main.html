  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I've always been fascinated by how technology shapes the world around us. Becoming a software developer allows me to not only understand how digital systems work but also to create tools and solutions that can help people in real ways. I enjoy problem-solving and building things from scratch, and software development offers an endless playground for creativity and logic. The idea of turning an idea into something real and useful with just code is incredibly motivating for me. Plus, the learning never stops in this field, which keeps me constantly challenged and engaged.
